#58 	SIMIND DEFAULT SWITCHES
-----------------------

/CC	Collimator code according to the description in the CHANGE program. 
Note that you should not include the '*' as is necessary in the CHANGE. 
For example simind input/cc:ge-legp gives this collimator in the 
simulation regarding of what is given in the smc file[Character input] 

/CS	Collimator flag: Selects that only geometrical=1, penetration=2 or 
scattering=3 in the collimator are allowed.

/DF	This switch is used when simulating heart beating and respiratory 
movements using MCAT/NCAT phantom. Since each segment from MCAT/NCAT has 
its own image file with a particular number this switch makes a patch to 
the file name of the density file. For example, suppose you have 
generated 8 segment of a beating heart using the base name "test". The 
output from NCAT give you files named test_act_1.bin, 
test_atn_2.bin,...test_atn_8.bin. If you add the switch /SF:3 then you 
will use the source map test_act_3.bin even if the input file says test. 
If this switch is not given then it will open the file test_atn_av.bin as 
is the standard name for the average source image from ncat

/ES	Energy offset relative to Index 01 in keV for the center energy of 
the photo peak window. Negative value means lower value than index 1. If 
this shift is not given then the center value of the energy window is 
defined by index 1. 
 
/FA	This switch in combination with a number turns off the simulation 
flag for the corresponding number. For example /FA:5 turns of SPECT 
simulation. To set a flag to true then use the switch /TR

/FZ	Give the name for the zubal file without the extension 'zub' 
[Character input]

/FI	Give the name for the isotope file without the extension 'isd' 
[Character input]

/FD	Base name for the density map (*.dmi) or the NCAT attenuation 
map[Character input]

/FS	Base name for the source map (*.smi) or the NCAT activity 
map[Character input]

/I2	Image files are stored as integer*2 matrices. By default a scaling 
factor is calculated from the first projection so that the maximum in 
that projection will be 1000. If a data value is gives after /I2 then 
that value will be used as a scaling factor

/LO	Number of photon histories before printout of the ongoing status 
line. Require a data value. The default is 1000.

/LF	A samplings technique based on linear sampling of the polar angle 
for the photon direction is used. Note that this is only useful when 
simulating the simindc and the scattwinc programs with the new 
collimator. 

/OR	Parameter that changes the orientation of the density map. Value 2 
transpose the maps, value 3 swaps the maps so index (1,1) is the lower 
left and value 4 both transpose and swaps.

/PR	Start simulation at projection number given by the switch. Default 
value is projection 1.

/PU	In some cases it is more convenient to express the centre of the 
source in terms of pixel unit instead for cm and let the computer 
calculate the physical centre position. By using the /PU (= pixel units) 
switch on can give the shift of the source in pixel units according to $ 
simind input/16:38/17:128/18:64/PU. From the phantom length and the 
density pixel size is calculated the true source shift in cm. If the 
command looks like $ simind input/16:38/17:128/18:64/PU:0.25 then the 
position is scaled down by a factor of four. It?s used when the pixel 
units are valid for e.g. a 512 matrix but the actual density map used in 
the simulation is only a 128 matrix.

/QF	Quit the simulation if an earlier result file exists. This flag is 
useful if a batch simulation has been ongoing and the computer has been 
restarted following a power-failure. This may then prevent recalculation 
of already existing data files.

/SC	Maximum number of scatter orders allowed in the phantom. Require a 
data value. A large number requires more computing time since more 
multiple scattered photons will be followed in the phantom. In some case 
(for example, when simulating images obtained in a narrow energy window) 
a lower value may be sufficient since the lower energy photon with a low 
probability is rejected by the energy window. The user must therefore be 
careful so the proper number of scatter orders is simulated for the 
particular simulation. It can be necessary to do some 'trial-and-error' 
simulation. The default value is 3. If scatter order are a negative value 
the only the scatter distribution is simulated and stored in the images 
and spectrum.

/SW	Swap the bytes in the integer image file created if the switch /I" 
have been given. The Interfile file key "number format" is properly set 
according to the computer that is used. For example, if running on a PC 
the number format will be BIGENDIAN if /SW is given and LITTLEENDIAN if 
the running computer is a SUN

/SF	This switch is used when simulating heart beating and respiratoric 
movements using MCAT/NCAT phantom. Since each segment from MCAT/NCAT has 
its own image file with a particular number this switch makes a patch to 
the file name of the density file. For example, suppose you have 
generated 8 segment of a beating heart using the base name "test". The 
output from NCAT give you files named test_act_1.bin, 
test_act_2.bin,...test_act_8.bin. If you add the switch /SF:3 then you 
will use the source map test_act_3.bin even if the input file says test. 
If this switch is not given then it will open the file test_act_av.bin as 
is the standard name for the average source image from ncat
 
/TR:	Turns on simulation flag corresponding to the number. For example, 
/TR:12 turns on simulation of the energy resolution. 

/TS	A time shift can be added to the date and time description in the 
interfile header. The initial time and date is set in the simind.ini file 
and the value of the /TS switch is the extension of this time expressed 
in hours. Note that it must be a positive value greater or equal to 0.s

/UA	Set the density equal to the data buffer or if not present equal to 
1.0 (=water). This makes the phantom equal to uniform attenuated 
regardless of the initial voxel value in the phantom.

/WB	Whole Body Simulation of Anterior and Posterior view. Note that you 
might need to adjust the Matrix size with simparam and the detector 
length (index 8)..When this switch is given the following parameters is 
set

Number of projections = 2
Interfile = .true.
Phantom flag = .true.
Rotation type = 0 (360 degrees)

/XP	Number of split photons emitted from the last interaction point in 
the phantom. This parameter can be used to increase the statistics in the 
images.

/Xn	'n' specifies the cross-section that can be changed. The X1-X5 
refers to the index 9,10,11,12 and 15 in the main CHANGE menu and X6 is 
the material for the collimator when using the simindc, 
scattwinc.[Character input]

#59 	The zubal file that you have used is not in the proper format for 
this version of the code. You have to use the template vox_man.zub in the 
SMC_DIR directory and add your activity data. Note that this version of 
vox_man.zub also contains the density for each of the organ and these 
values are very easy for you to change.
#60 	An unknown compiler number has been defined in the smc_dir.for 
file. Please check the list or contact Michael Ljungberg to make an 
update of SIMIND to the new compiler.
#61 	An error occurred when trying to open the MCAT source file. Please 
check if the file exists or if the file name has been miss-spelled.  
 
Error occurred in routine SMAP.
#62 	An error occurred when trying to read from the input file that 
defines the tumors. The file name should be the same as the input file 
but with the extension *.inp
#63 	An error occurred when trying to open the MCAT phantom file. Please 
check if the file exists or if the file name has been miss-spelled.
#64 	An error has occurred when trying to read from the MCAT phantom 
file. Please check that the number of images that is specified in Index 
34 is correct and that the start image + the number of images do not 
exceed the number of images in the file.
#65 	You have not specified a step size for the simulation of the 
photons inside the voxel-based phantom. The step size is defined in 
change index 38 and should be a value that is less than the pixel size of 
the phantom but not to low in order to keep the computation time down. A 
value of 1/2 to 1/3 should be OK. 
#66 	There was an error when reading the *.zub file. Please check the 
file and the way values are stored again a valid file, such as the file 
vox_man.zub in the smc_dir directory.  
 
Error occurred in the GET_ZUBAL_DATA routine.
#67 	The values in the columns of the *.zub seems to be in the wrong 
positions. Please check the file and the way values are stored again a
